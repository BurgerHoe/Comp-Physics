Starting with Homework Two, I will be committing my original code as "Initual commit"
If that works then I will answer the conceptual questions and commit the final ipnyb file as "Final Commit"
If the initial code does not work I will be committing many times until it does

Please only concern yourself with the "Final Commit"
